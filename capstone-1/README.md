Vend-O-Matic Deluxe was created by Jamie Hershberger and Awal Bhuyan for the first capstone project for Merit America’s Java Development Program. We were given some preliminary code, but had to finish out the program working as a team.

Following is a script Jamie created for presentation of the project to the cohort and the coaches.
Enjoy!

Part I - Introductions (1 minute)
JAMIE: Thank you for the opportunity to present our program, Vend-O-Matic Deluxe, a virtual vending machine that displays items for purchase, accepts a selection and cash amount from the user, tracks inventory, then displays a message and the change amount as it dispenses the selected item.

Our roles in the team were as follows: 

AWAL:Im Awal and I was the driver

JAMIE : I’m Jamie and I was the navigator. Our approach was to  tackle the components roughly in the order of the ReadMe file, from which we created a sort of skeleton of the overall progra. We then composed and maintained a “punch list” of items to handle later in order to make the code function properly as well as to “pretty it up,” including customizing the messages displayed to the user.

Now I’m going to share my screen and turn the mic over to Awal who will take us through the code. 

Part II - Demonstrating the Code
AWAL: We added 3 Classes to work with VendingMachineCli
Inventory
Cash
Item
Item is an abstract class that is extended by 4 classes in our Sources folder. We have a test for each one
Candy - run test
Chips - run test
Drinks  - runt test
Gum - run test
There is also a test for Inventory - run test
And then we have a log class 

*Show Off VedingMachineCLI*
*run the code*
Part III - Closing Remarks(1 minute )
Did the team reflect on the project and what they learned?

JAMIE: I loved this project. The idea of building a vending machine was amazing as it was a concrete, real world concept and easy to visualize. I personally learned a lot from working with Awal. He is very persistent and dedicated and we spent many hours puzzling over tricky parts of the code. I also learned that it is important to communicate your thought process every step of the way, especially when you have control of the screen so your partner can help you problem solve.

AWAL: This project really reinforced concepts we’ve learned for the past 9 weeks. I did not feel confident in my abilities. Actually I still don’t haha, but I feel like my understanding has deepened just a little bit further, there were occurrences where I figured things out by playing with the sandbox of my mind and made a breakthrough while we were both stuck in a rut.
